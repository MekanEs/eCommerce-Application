### `Task:`
**Sprint 1:** [Set up ESLint  + Script](https://mekanes1997.atlassian.net/browse/KAN-9)

### `Description:`
Automate the process of code review, identify problems early in development, and maintain a consistent coding style across a project with ESLint

### `Execution steps:`
1. Installed ESLint, required plugins and their dependencies into the project using npm.
2. Tweaked the ESLint configuration to match our team's development standards.
3. Let's add a script to the "scripts" section of the package.json file to easily run code review with ESLint.
4. A test run of the script was made to make sure that ESLint works correctly and issues warnings about possible problems in the code.
5. Fixed bugs reported by ESLint.
